I don\u2032t see a car in sight\nSix days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight\n\nWell, my rig's a little old but that don\u2032t mean she\u2032s slow\nThere's a flame from her stack and the smoke\u2032s blowing black as coal\nMy home town is coming in sight, if you think I'm happy you\u2032re right\nSix days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight\nSix days on the road and I\u2032m gonna make it home tonight\n\n16 forward gears, diesel smoke trailing in the wind\n18 tires checked and singing on the pavement\nFive thousand miles to cover, three weeks away from home\nAnd it's work, mister, it demands the best\nAnd whether your run is on Interstate 70 or hauling freight down the eastern seaboard\nIf you're a gear jammer, you know there ain\u2032t no easy runs\n\nI was sittin\u2032 in the terminal waitin' for my load\nWhen a greenhorn driver came in, off the road\nI heard him tell that foreman get my little pink slip\nThis run is too tough and I\u2032m gonna quit\n\nNow, the foreman that day happened to be old Joe\nMan, he was older than time\nHe said, \"Son, how long you been driving this rig?\"\n\"You know, I've drove all shapes, forms, fashions and kinds\"\n\"And here you are worried about this one little trip\"\n\"Why, I\u2032ve drove a million miles and then some\"\nHe looked that greenhorn right in the eye and he said\n\"Boy, there ain't no easy runs\"\n\nI\u2032ve drove for Roadway, Interstate, Hopewell, Great Lakes\nWalford Mac, Time, Mayflower, Freight Lines\nSpecter, Yellow Transit, Western and Gillete\nRed Ball, Rider, North Western, Big Seattle\nBeaver, Bell, Hoover, McLeans, Gateway, Motor Freight, Transport Pikes\nDixie, Ohio, Trans American South, East Tex Mason, Dixon, Watkin and Transcon\nWilson, Associates got all that driving done\nAnd I tell you, boy, there ain't no easy runs\n\nSaid, \"If you got a gal in Texas, they'll send you up to Maine\nAnd if you got a gal in New York, they\u2032ll send you out on the plains\"\n\"I know what your problem is, you got woman trouble, son\"\nAnd I tell you, boy, there ain\u2032t no easy run\n\nI've drove for Navajo, Rate, Goose, DC\nNorth American, Caroline, Baltimore, Freight Park\nNew Mac, Curtis, Eastern and then NX\nGarrett, Hayes, Federal and ETM\nAnd Neptune, Herron, Brinks and Sea Lab\nFirst Dudley, Dorsey, Bekins and Billingham\nCooper, Detroit, Jones and American, too\nNightway and Central, Standard and Boston Sue\nYunham, Buckingham got all that driving done\nAnd I tell you, boys, there ain\u2032t no easy run\n\nI've drove for United, Acme, Tanksley and Shaw\nGrammar, Atlas, Strickland and Docks\nAtlantic, Owens, Karin and Bullman\nH&H, Murphy Field and Mohawk\nSkill, Skags got all the driving done\nAnd I tell you, boys, there ain\u2032t no easy run\nAin't no easy run\n\nThe next time you see a big semi roaring down the highway\nRemember the man at the wheel has a great heritage in America\nLike the Pony Express rider, the stagecoach driver and the wagon master of old\nNo matter what the weather, no matter where the road\nHe\u2032s the man that delivers the goods\nAnd whatever you eat tonight, whatever you wear, wherever you sleep\nRemember it's very likely that it was a trucker\nThat brought you your food, clothers and your bed\n\nWell, my ocean is four lanes wide, my waves are mountain high\nI sail a 20 ton schooner with the will of do or die\nAnd my cargo must go through to the port that waits for me\nI live on luck for I drive a truck, I'm a sailor on a concrete sea\nSo, here\u2032s to the unsung hero, though he don\u2032t make history\nFrom coast to coast, let's drink a toast\nTo the sailor on a concrete sea, the sailor on a conrete sea\n\nTake it easy truckers, there ain\u2032t no easy run"

I'm terrified\nIt lingers in my mind\nAnd the thought keeps on getting bigger\nI\u2032m sorry my sweet baby, I wish I've been there\n\nIt\u2032s been so long\nSince I last have seen my son lost to this monster\nTo the man behind the slaughter\nSince you've been gone\nI've been singing this stupid song so I could ponder\nThe sanity of your mother"

You shooting at me?\nThis cannot be true, not it cannot be\n\nI been sinking down into the depths like quicksand with a red stripe\nI been fucked before\nSo don\u2032t trust the Lord, I got no faith for the blessed hype\nI got bars dropping like an\nAirstrike, kinda hard for us to fare right?\nWhen the cream don't really rise up like it used to\nOur clique is so consistent with the\nHits so you\u2032d just have to be a skitzo\nTo be unsure that \u00a1MAYDAY! is still the shit bro\nI calypso on your tombstone for even\nThinking you could take a snooze slow\nY'all want a hit? Come holler at the goons, that\u2032s what I think\n\n'Cause this one's for the kids\nThis one\u2032s for the kids, ignorance is bliss\n\u2032Til they come for every little\nFucking thing, and ain't that \u2032bout a bitch\nBut I down a fifth, about to make a hit\nBoutta get away to my cave and prepare for nuclear waste\nThey always doing too much, always divide and conquer\nGot my Flor de Ca\u00f1a and flowers for Santa Barbara\nI'ma show you how, and I\u2032m gon' tell you \u2032til I come down\nI'ma go get me some indo- now, kill the noise when I make it loud\n\nDouble entendre, mom said a mantra\nShe off in division of energy, let me conquer\nSickenin' doctors\nAnd hospice and moccasins while I\u2032m taking call conferences\nYeah you don\u2032t got your hot in this, I bleed this, make enemies ovules\nKnocking the vision\nAin't nobody hot as this, rocking any bitch niggas talking shit\nLook, I\u2032m a role model at this, no cuss words when I talk to the kids\nShe give me brain like \"Hop on this shit\"\nPussy and it's feeling so we hop in this shit\nPassing the six, infinite bliss, heroine flow when I\u2032m mopping at this\nBatman, no I'm Robin at this\nExcept when the mask on, robbin\u2032 his clique\n\nKeep it real fair while they still\nCan't understand how I could just kill a man\nNever realized I could see inside of a killer mind like a Will Graham\nMost certainly hold currency like a Brinks team, no security\nCurious why you ain't never heard of me?\n\u2032Cause I sink deep while they stirring tea\nSubterranean alien, stunned and gunning over greedy beats\nFake bulletins, they full of shit\nPlumed and running under city streets\nNothing worse than a pipe dream, want smoke? Better know that my team\nWith the hijinx that determ\u2032 why eyes pink bruh\nYou don't wanna know what I think\n\nWhy do they wanna be all on me like\nI was catering, told \u2032em I play to win\nHaters who waited on me to be caving in\nGotta come up with a whole 'nother way to win\nDumping that paddle on top of the paint again\nBreaking the chain to get over the gate again\nFeeling so livid the minute I made it in\nHead over heels when they come in to hate on it\nBut it never matted like the weather pattern\nSo every father-fucking head I\u2032m gathering\nIs stones to wrap around the wrings of Saturn\nAnd I'm more than happy that I had to pack \u2032em in\nGet a dick full for fucking with the Deevil\nI'm a curse of the worst version of he who can eat people"

It's me!\nCan\u2032t say I feel proud, this doesn\u2032t warrant vanity\nThe looking glass is frosted over and we cannot see\n\nSo we place our faith and hopes and dreams in smoke and steam\nI mean, why would we go to those extremes if we don't believe?\nSo hunker down and dig in for the coldest winter tide\nSince you convinced your prideful self that you\u2032ve nothing to hide\n\nThe wheels of progress frozen, motionless\nUnless we thaw all these unspoken spokes\nThen death is coming home\nThe wheels of progress frozen, motionless\nUnless we thaw all these unspoken spokes\nWell, then, we're going home\n\nEver since the first of us huddled round the fire\nWith nothing to hide, but animal hides as attire\nOur entire world was centred and dependent on supplies of carbon\nThe new oxygen that we require to respire\n\nWe pampered life\u2032s complexities, manufactured luxuries\nWhile suffocating nature's lungs when we cut the trees\nNow our comeuppance seems to be to huddle round the fire\nWith everything to hide and animal hides as attire\n\nWhat goes around will come around, whatever\u2032s underground\nWill come up now, you're not expecting it, and damn well hunt you down\nSo hunker down and dig in for the coldest winter tide\nSince you convinced your prideful self that you've nothing to hide\n\nThe wheels of progress frozen, motionless\nUnless we thaw all these unspoken spokes\nThen death is coming home\nThe wheels of progress frozen, motionless\nUnless we thaw all these unspoken spokes\nWell, then, we\u2032re going home\n\nOur stomachs are the furnaces, our open throats the chimney\nOur hearts the flowing pumps that need the bellow lungs to bring heat\nBut our brittle bodies are a pitiful device\nTrying to subsist upon a trickle of supplies\n\nWith the vittles diminishing, I don\u2032t think it will suffice\nAlthough, species evolve quicker when it's difficult to thrive\nBut that theory isn\u2032t something that always applies\nDeprive us enough, we'll suffer our inevitable demise\n\nWe are each expendable, but the city must survive\nIt\u2032s just a pleasant bonus if it keeps us alive\nSo hunker down and dig in for the coldest winter tide\nSince you convinced your prideful self that you've nothing to hide\n\nThe wheels of progress frozen, motionless\nUnless we thaw all these unspoken spokes\nThen death is coming home\nThe wheels of progress frozen, motionless\nUnless we thaw all these unspoken spokes\nWell, then, we\u2032re going home"

(Danger)\n\nAyy, gettin' old, they doubted us\nMakes it that more marvelous\nSign 'em up \u2032cause I\u2032m in this vibes\nAnd I get anonymous\nWhat's up, danger?\nAyy, don\u2032t be a stranger\n'Cause I like high chances that I might lose (Lose)\nI like it all on the edge just like you, ayy\nI like tall buildings so I can leap off of \u2032em\nI go hard wit' it no matter how dark it is\n\nI\u2032m insane but on my toes\nI could keep the world balanced on my nose\nI had a slumber party wit' all my foes\nNow I wear them like a badge of honor all my clothes\nIf I'm crazy, I\u2032m on my own\nIf I\u2032m waitin', it\u2032s on my throne\nIf I sound lazy, just ignore my tone\n'Cause I\u2032m always gonna answer when you call my phone\n\nLike what's up, danger? (Danger)\nLike what\u2032s up, danger? (Danger)\nDon-don't be a stranger\nWhat's up, danger?\n\nTwo hundred miles per hour wit\u2032 a blindfold on (On)\nMom always askin\u2032, \"Where did I go wrong?\" (Wrong)\nWhat's up, danger?\nAh, what\u2032s up, danger?\nTraveled two hundred miles, I'm knockin\u2032 at your door\nAnd I don't really care if you ain\u2032t done wrong, come on\nWhat's up, danger? (Danger)\nDon't be a stranger (Stranger)\n\nI like it when trouble brews, I won\u2032t dare change\nI like it when there\u2032s turbulence on my airplanes\nI like it when I assess things that I can't see yet\nSwimmin\u2032 with sharks when they ain't feed yet\n\u2032Cause I like high chances that I might lose\nI like it all on the edge just like you, ayy\nI like tall buildings so I can leap off of 'em\nI go hard wit\u2032 it no matter how dark it is\n\nOoh\nOoh\nOhh\n\nIf I'm crazy, I'm on my own\nIf I\u2032m waitin\u2032, it's on my throne\nIf I sound lazy, just ignore my tone\n\u2032Cause I'm always gonna answer when you call my phone\n\nLike what\u2032s up, danger? (Danger)\nLike what's up, danger? (Danger)\n\nCan\u2032t stop me now\nI said, \"I got you now\"\nI'm right here at your door\nI won't leave, I want more\nWhat\u2032s up, danger?\nYeah, what\u2032s up, danger?\nCan't stop me now, yeah\nI said I got you now\nCome on, what\u2032s up, danger?\nCome on, I said, \"What's up, danger?\""
